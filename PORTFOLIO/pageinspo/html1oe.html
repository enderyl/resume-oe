                <h2>about me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Olivia--I'm over there on the left side of the left side. I'm a third time freshman student at TCC, but I know what's going on around here (love that concurrent stuff). Iâ€™m 18 and leeching off my mom at the moment...</p>

                <p>I have two dogs and two younger sisters: Natalee, who's now hopped over to TCC, and Abigail, pictured <i>right</i> on the left side.</p>
                <p>In my bio of so many years past (1) I mentioned that I was taking HTML to "see where it goes." As evidenced by my major, it is definitely going!</p>

                <p>As for work? What work. I have been applying for 2 months. But I have a few interviews this week, so here's hoping that problem gets solved!</p>

            <p id="caption">Over the summer, I went on a once in a lifetime trip to Ecuador, partially because we have family down there! It was so cool. Especially for a first international trip. Left is Pailo&#769;n del Diablo ("The Devil's Cauldron") near Ban&#771;os. Below are a stack of sea lions on San Cristo&#769;bal Island, one of the Galapagos Islands. Sea lions are now my favorite animal...but the vicun&#771;as we spotted are a close second! I have <i>so many pictures.</i></p>
