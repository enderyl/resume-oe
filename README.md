This file collection creates a resume page (for me). Exposed files in main are really the only "important" pages, but really, all you need is the index.html file, which links to every page. Pretty cool if you ask me. Because this is about me, FOR ME, I'm the only admin (and editor). This is my first repository and/or page on Github, but I ended up translating most of my work from VS Code easily. Pyscript took two days and many hours though...

Speaking of, the Python pages are translated to browser and interpreted with the help of Pyscript! However there had to be some pretty extensive editing for the original Python to morph into something that Pyscript would display to the user accurately. Thus why there are two Python files: 1. py8oe.py (the original, 'legacy' code) and 2. py4script.py (the abridged and Pyscript-adjusted code)!
