These files compose my resume. Start at CLICKME.html and explore the other files attached *through that file.* This site is organized into 3 parts--exposed pages, the PORTFOLIO folder, and the resources folder.

Exposed pages are the html/python pages that are Right In Front Of You, like CLICKME.html.
The PORTFOLIO folder contains two html files and two folders. The html files are separate projects, and each folder is one project (containing an html file, css file, and either photos or a javascript file).
The resources contains two files that are the backbone of the exposed files. They are resumesettings.css and resume.js.

Anyway, that's all you really need to know. Open CLICKME.html and explore!
